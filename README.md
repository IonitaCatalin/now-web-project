## 📒 Requirements 

Using the official data regarding public [notary entities [RO]](https://data.gov.ro/dataset/notari-publici) and [authorized translators + interpreters [RO]](https://data.gov.ro/dataset/traducatori-si-interpreti), develop a smart modular Web system capable to provide support for locating offices and services – such as notarized documents: acknowledgments, oaths/affirmations, copy certification, signature witnessing, others legal procedures – according to user preferences, geographical places, fees, restrictions, and other aspects (e.g., support for foreign citizens) – consider also [legal paper provenance](https://www.provbook.org/tutorial/provenanceweek2014/). Via SPARQL endpoints, the application will offer useful maps – see also [Place](https://schema.org/Place) schema.org concept – and additional knowledge (contact info, timetable, reviews, related points of interest) about each notary office.
